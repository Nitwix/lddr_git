## Ultra capitalism
- shows how capitalism could look like in a few years if it follows the current trend

- quote chapter 3, p. 26: (appears in the whole book +-) 
The door refused to open. It said, ‘Five cents, please.’

- quote chapter 7, p. 62:
‘One of these days,’ Joe said wrathfully, ‘people like me will rise up and overthrow you, and the end of tyranny by the homeostatic machine will have arrived. The day of human values and compassion and simple warmth will return, and when that happens someone like myself who has gone through an ordeal and who genuinely needs hot coffee to pick him up and keep him functioning when he has to function will get the hot coffee whether he happens to have a poscred readily available or not.’

- chapter 8, p. 73
Well, he could take an amphetamine instead; the hotel probably provided them free, as a courtesy.
-> strange: the only free thing in the world is a drug that cuts hunger/excites (?) 

- chapter 8, p. 77:
‘Isn’t Walt Disney’s head supposed to be on the fifty-cent piece?’ Sammy said. ‘Either Disney’s,’ Al said, ‘or if it’s an older one, then Fidel Castro’s. Let’s see it.’

- chapter 9, p. 82
The pack of cigarettes slid from the chute and onto the counter. ‘Ninety-five cents,’ the checker said.

- chapter 10, p.94
"in one respect it had improved – it lacked the coin slot, operating obviously toll-free. This aspect was true of all the appliances"

- [SuvaRisk Coin Slot](https://youtu.be/d0PzJJOiocY)

- almost everything belongs to companies (coins with Walt Disney, private lunar bases)

- not that far from our reality x)

# Script
+ explosion video
- Pat: Oh no, it was a trap!
- Joe: Runciter is almost dead, what are we gonna do?
+ put badges off
- Niels: So our main characters fell into a trap, which is going to greatly influence their future.
- Nina: This trap was almost certainly organized by Runciter's worst enemy, Hollis.
- Niels: In the world of Ubik, some people are gifted with some psychological talents such as telepathy (called thelepaths), the power to foresee the future (called precogs), the ability to resurect people from the dead (called resurrectors) and so on. These people are recruted by Hollis to spy on companies or individuals or to interfere with people in a way that is profitable to the person who has paid for the service that Hollis provides.
- Nina: On the other hand, some people have anti-psy abilities. For each psy ability, there is an anti-psy ability: for example, there are anti-telepaths, anti-precogs and so on. The people with these abilities can cancel the powers of the psis. They are recruited by Runciter Associates and companies who think they are spied upon can pay for protection from Runciter Associates.
- Niels: But our characters will soon discover that it was more than a simple explosion that they experienced. They soon experience some strange time related issues...
+ put badges on
- Joe: hey, what happened with my cigarettes? They seem to have aged months since the last time I smoked one. Strange... But anyways, we have to call the moratorium in Zurich to announce that we are bringing Runciter.
- Pat:
