## Ultra capitalism
- shows how capitalism could look like in a few years if it follows the current trend

- quote chapter 3, p. 26: (appears in the whole book +-) 
The door refused to open. It said, ‘Five cents, please.’

- quote chapter 7, p. 62:
‘One of these days,’ Joe said wrathfully, ‘people like me will rise up and overthrow you, and the end of tyranny by the homeostatic machine will have arrived. The day of human values and compassion and simple warmth will return, and when that happens someone like myself who has gone through an ordeal and who genuinely needs hot coffee to pick him up and keep him functioning when he has to function will get the hot coffee whether he happens to have a poscred readily available or not.’

- chapter 8, p. 73
Well, he could take an amphetamine instead; the hotel probably provided them free, as a courtesy.
-> strange: the only free thing in the world is a drug that cuts hunger/excites (?) 

- chapter 8, p. 77:
‘Isn’t Walt Disney’s head supposed to be on the fifty-cent piece?’ Sammy said. ‘Either Disney’s,’ Al said, ‘or if it’s an older one, then Fidel Castro’s. Let’s see it.’

- chapter 9, p. 82
The pack of cigarettes slid from the chute and onto the counter. ‘Ninety-five cents,’ the checker said.

- chapter 10, p.94
"in one respect it had improved – it lacked the coin slot, operating obviously toll-free. This aspect was true of all the appliances"

- almost everything belongs to companies (coins with Walt Disney, private lunar bases)

- not that far from our reality x)

# Script
+ explosion video
- Pat: Oh no, it was a trap!
- Joe: Runciter is almost dead, what are we gonna do?

## Psy explanation
+ put badges off
- Niels: So our main characters fell into a trap, which is going to greatly influence their future.
- Nina: This trap was almost certainly organized by Runciter's worst enemy, Hollis.
- Niels: In the world of Ubik, some people are gifted with some psychological talents such as telepathy (called thelepaths), the power to foresee the future (called precogs), the ability to resurect people from the dead (called resurrectors) and so on. These people are recruted by Hollis to spy on companies or individuals or to interfere with people in a way that is profitable to the person who has paid for the service that Hollis provides.
- Nina: On the other hand, some people have anti-psy abilities. For each psy ability, there is an anti-psy ability: for example, there are anti-telepaths, anti-precogs and so on. The people with these abilities can cancel the powers of the psis. They are recruited by Runciter Associates and companies who think they are spied upon can pay for protection from Runciter Associates.
- Niels: [freedom of thought]
- Niels: But our characters will soon discover that they were victims of more than a simple explosion. They soon experience some strange time related issues...

## Time-related events
+ put badges on
- Joe: hey, what happened with my cigarettes? They seem to have aged months since the last time I smoked one. Strange... But anyways, we have to call the moratorium in Zurich to announce that we are bringing Runciter.
- Pat: Ok, I'll fetch the telephone book. [searches trough the book] The number is 032 196 92 39.
- Joe: Strange..., the phone doesn't seem to recognize this number. The telephone book must have aged as well.
+ put badges off
- Nina: that point of book, we had few theories: 2 theories : 1) psy hallucination. never left past 2) 2 realities , bug of timeline because of pat.
- Niels: 


## Runciter-related events
+ pub "interactive" (video)
- Runciter: One invisible puff-puff whisk of economically priced Ubik banishes compulsive obsessive fears that the entire world is turning into clotted milk, worn-out tape recorders and obsolete iron-cage elevators, plus other, further, as-yet-unglimpsed manifestations of decay. You see, world deterioration of this regressive type is a normal experience of many half-lifers, especially in the early stages when ties to the real reality are still very strong.
- [Joe] : But how can that be possible???
- Runciter: Well you see Joe, by making use of the most advanced techniques of present-day science, the reversion of matter to earlier forms can be reversed, and at a price any conapt owner can afford. So look for it, Joe. Don’t just sit there; go out and buy a can of Ubik and spray it all around you night and day.
- [Joe] : Does that mean you can hear and see me?
- Runciter: Of course, I can’t hear you and see you. This commercial message is on videotape; I recorded it two weeks ago, specifically, twelve days before my death. I knew the bomb blast was coming; I made use of precog talents. Return to your conapt, Mr Chip, and you’ll find a free sample has arrived by mail, a free introductory sample, Mr Chip, that will keep you going until you can buy a regular-size can.
